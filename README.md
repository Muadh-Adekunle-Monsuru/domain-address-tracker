# Minimalist Domain Address Locator

This repository contains the code for a minimalist website that provides the physical address of a domain. The site uses the [IPify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) to convert the domain to a physical address and [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) along with [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) to display the location on a map.

## Features

- Convert a domain to its physical address using the IPify API.
- Display the location on an interactive map using React-Leaflet and LeafletJS.
